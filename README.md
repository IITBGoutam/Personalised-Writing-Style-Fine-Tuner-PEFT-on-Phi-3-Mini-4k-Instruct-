 The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained instruction-following model (phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) to reproduce a  writing style of the author ie me based on a limited set (75 samples) of text segments(will expand later).
 I am part of the institutes official media body and while writing articles I could not use chatgpt beacuse of it's artificial language style , even humaniszers are not good as they decrease the quality of output 
 I like my wirting style and would love if chatgpt/other llms could write in this style
 This enables personalised AI writing, where the model generates text that reflects the phrasing, rhythm, and tone of the user’s style,
