The dynamic further exacerbates growing anxieties about social isolation, critics contend, forming a paradoxical cycle where the very AI models implicated in deepening human disconnection are now widely offered as conversational tools to mitigate it.
<|end|>
<|assistant|>
This adds into the already fueled fire of social isolation, creating a vicious loop when these very LLMs contributing to the problem start offering chat products to ‘solve’ it.

Ashoka University is launching on-campus labs designed to support student assignments with supervised artificial intelligence. These dedicated facilities will permit students to complete coursework onsite, operating either without Large Language Models (LLMs) or with a restricted, scaffolded LLM functioning exclusively as a teaching assistant, ensuring controlled and guided AI support.

The line between human and artificial intelligence output has blurred, with Professor Alok Takkar of Ashoka University reporting instances where his own writing was mistaken for LLM-generated text. While academic integrity challenges, including assignment copying, predate the widespread adoption of large language models, the current proliferation of low-quality, machine-generated submissions has significantly complicated efforts to distinguish genuine student work and assess its quality.
<|end|>
<|assistant|>
It has happened that sometimes what I have written has been said to be LLM output by such tools” Alok Takkar, Prof at Ashoka While copying assignments is not new and it used to happen even before the advent of LLMs, right now, due to the level of AI slop, it has become much harder to distinguish between their quality.
