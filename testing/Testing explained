The fine-tuned model was tested using unseen neutral sentences.
Outputs from both the base and fine-tuned models were compared using Sentence-BERT embedding similaritys.
The fine-tuned model showed higher similarity scores and was more often identified as matching the user’s style, confirming successful adaptation.
